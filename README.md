# AccessibilityComponent

## Overview

`AccessibilityComponent` is a React component designed to enhance web accessibility by providing essential features that support users with disabilities. It is intended to be used as part of a broader strategy for making web applications accessible.

## Installation

To install the component, use npm or yarn:

```
npm install accessibility-component
```

or

```
yarn add accessibility-component
```

## Usage

Import and use the component in your React application:

      <h1>My Accessible Web App</h1>
      <AccessibilityComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Important Notice

Using `AccessibilityComponent` alone does not guarantee full accessibility compliance. It is the responsibility of developers to build their web applications following the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) accessibility standards. This includes proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigability, sufficient color contrast, and providing alternative text for images, among other requirements.

For comprehensive guidance on making your website accessible, refer to the official [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) guidelines.
